# MEGA ROCKET SA

The company MEGA ROCKET SA is a gym with members and employees 
that has a web system that facilitates the management of its 
schedule grid and the trainers in charge of each class, 
in such a way that its members can register dynamically without 
exceeding the space available.

## Week 01

During this week we created the screenflow of Mega Rocket SA gym in Figma 
and created prototypes for all screens.

The system has a main screen (landing) with different sections:
* Super admin
* Admin
* Coach
* Partner

## Week 02

I created an HTML document that has the same content as the screenflow landing
of the first week, using the desktop version adding all the content that 
is visible and saving the progress in a public Github repository using 
git to set up the remote repository.

## Week 03

I included the styles corresponding to the HTML structure of the second week 
to ensure that when viewing the page, it looks identical to the landing of
the screenflow of the first week in desktop view.

## Week 04

I replicated the landing page of the screenflow of the first week using 
Flexbox and Media Queries as the main tool for the creation of a 
Responsive Design following the Mobile First concept.

I used Github Pages to display the static files in the repository.

## Week 05

I did exercises to learn different JavaScript functionalities. 
Each exercise block was saved in a new JS file inside a folder called “exercises”.

The blocks of exercises were the following:
   * 01-variables-and-operators.js
   * 02-strings.js
   * 03-arrays.js
   * 04-if-else.js
   * 05-for.js
   * 06-functions.js
